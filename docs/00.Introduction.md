# Introduction
## 1. Code example
```kt
data class Person(
    val name: String,
    val age: Int? = null
)

func main() {
    val x: Int = 1
    val y = 2

    val persons = listOf(
        Person(name = "Alice", age = 10),
        Person(name = "Frank")
    )

    val oldest = persons.maxBy {
        it.age ?: 0
    }
}
```

## 2. Kotlin primary traits 
- **Kotlin use cases: Android, server side, anywhere where Java runs, and beyond**
- **Static typing:**
    - Performant: Calling methods is faster because there is no need to determine which method needs to be called at run time
    - Reliable: The compiler uses types to verify the consistency of the program.
    - Maintainable: Easier to work with unfamiliar code.
    - Tool support: Static typing enables reliable refactorings, precise code completion, and other IDE features
- **Combining functional and object-oriented programming -> Flexible and reliable**
    - Key concept of functional programming:
        - *First-class functions* - You work with functions (pieces of behaviour) as values. You can store them in variables, pass them as parameters, or return them from other functions
        - *Immutability* - You work with immutable objects, which guarantees their state can't change after their creation.
        - *No side effects* - You write pure functions, functions that return the same result given the same inputs and dont modify the state of other objects or interact with the outside world
- **Concurrent and asynchronous code becomes natural and structured with coroutines**
- **Kotlin can be used for any purpose: Its free, open source, and open to contributions**

## 3. Areas in which Kotlin is often used
- **Powering backends: Server-side development with Kotlin**
    - It can be used very well with springboot
- **Mobile Developement: Android is Kotlin first**
- **Multiplatform: Sharing business logic and minimizing duplicate work on iOS, JVM, JS, and beyond**

## 4. The philosophy of Kotlin
- Pragmatic, concise, safe.
